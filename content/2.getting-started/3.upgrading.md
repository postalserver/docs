<alert>
If you're not currently running Postal v2, you'll need to follow the Upgrading from 1.x documentation before you can use these instructions.
</alert>

Once you have installed Postal, you can upgrade it by running this command. This will always upgrade you to the latest version of Postal that is available.

```bash
cd /opt/postal/install
git pull origin
postal upgrade
```

This will do a few things in the following order:

* Fetch the latest copy of the installation helpers repository using Git.
* Pull the latest version of the Postal containers.
* Perform any necessary updates to the database schema.
* Restart all running containers

This is not a zero downtime upgrade so it is recommended to do this at a time when traffic will be low and you have scheduled the maintenance as appropriate. If you need zero downtime upgrades, you will need to look for alternative container orchestration systems that can handle this (such as Kubernetes).

## Changing to a specific version

By default, running `postal upgrade` will install the latest version available from the Postal container registry. If you need to change the version of Postal to a specific version, you can specify a version for the `postal upgrade` command as follows:  

```bash
postal upgrade [version]
```
